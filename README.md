My name is George; commonly known as T3NED. I am a Computer Science, Business and English student from the United Kingdom. I consider myself hardworking but waste most of my free time procrastinating. I enjoy moderating because of the people I meet along the way.

I am the lead developer of [NedBot](https://www.nedbot.org); a moderation oriented general-purpose [Discord](https://discord.com) bot built with their [API](https://discord.com/developers). NedBot is composed in Typescript with love.
