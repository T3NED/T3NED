My name is George; commonly known as T3NED. I am a 16-year-old computer science student from the United Kingdom. I consider myself hardworking but waste most of my free time procrastinating. I enjoy moderating because of the people I meet along the way.

I am the CEO and Founder of [NedBot](https://www.nedbot.org); a moderation oriented general-purpose [Discord](https://discord.com) bot built with their [API](https://discord.com/developers). NedBot is composed in Typescript with love. Typescript is my favoured language.

I am the Chief Administrative Officer for [MenuDocs](https://menudocs.org); an organisation producing step-by-step tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/menudocs). Moreover, I am the lead developer of their [Discord](https://discord.com) server bot, Mandroc.
